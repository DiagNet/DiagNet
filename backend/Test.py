    Base class for defining and running test cases.

    This class provides a framework to define tests as methods prefixed with "test_".
    supports test dependencies, skipping, repeating, and expected failure handling.

    Tests are automatically discovered, ordered by dependencies, and executed with
    detailed result reporting, including pass/fail/skip status and logging output.

    Intended to be subclassed to implement specific tests by overriding setup, teardown,
    and defining test methods.
